- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total footfall, average bill/person, and average order/person.

## Dashboard Creation
Using Excel's built-in features, we will create a dashboard that visually represents the key insights from our analysis. The dashboard will include:

- Interactive charts (bar, line, pie charts)
- KPIs summary
- Filters for date ranges and product categories
  
**Steps to Create the Dashboard:**
- Insert Pivot Tables: Use pivot tables to summarize data.
- Create Charts: Visualize key metrics using appropriate chart types.
- Design Layout: Organize charts and tables for a clean, professional look.
- Add Interactivity: Use slicers and dropdowns to allow users to interact with the data.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we successfully analyzed coffee shop sales data to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior and sales performance. By leveraging Excel's data analysis and visualization tools, we created a dynamic dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore sales trends, understand customer preferences, and make informed decisions. The analysis not only highlights key sales metrics but also provides actionable insights for enhancing operational strategies and improving overall business performance.
